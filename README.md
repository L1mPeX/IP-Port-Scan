# IP-Port-Scan
This script checks for open ports any IP address, I put the most popular ports in the list for hacking, for example, if port 23 is open, you can make an SSH connection, i.e. remote access, if port 3306 is open, then this is a site and it has a vulnerability in the SQL database, which most likely contains logins and passwords from accounts on the site with this vulnerability
